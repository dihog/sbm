Superfund Sites in Reuse in Colorado Superfund. Mining then continued intermittently until the mid 1940s,when the mine was abandoned.Acid mine drainage from the site carried contamination into Peru Creek,a tributary of the Snake River.Mining waste and tailing deposits on the surface at the mine site are often washed into surface water during large runoff events. Landfill mining Wikipedia Landfill mining is also possible in countries where land is not available for new landfill sites.In this instance landfill space can be reclaimed by the extraction of biodegradable waste and other substances then refilled with wastes requiring disposal.Mining construction landfill sites is the simplest form of landfill mining. Mine waste dams threaten the environment,even when … Many mining operations store enormous quantities of waste,known as tailings,onsite.After miners excavate rock,a processing plant crushes it to recover valuable minerals such as gold or copper.The leftover pulverized rock and liquid slurry become tailings,which often are acidic and contain high concentrations of arsenic,mercury and other toxic substances. Salmon River Reservoir NYS Dept.of Environmental.
