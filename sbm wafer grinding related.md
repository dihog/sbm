SOI Wafer Thick SOI wafers ( > 2.0 μ device thickness) are currently produced by most manufacturers through grinding and polishing processes.Due to the inherent properties of grinding and polishing,these processes can achieve,at best,a thickness uniformity of + 0.5 μ. SOI Wafer MEMS Engineering This produces significant thickness variations for instance,for the standard 2.0 μ SOI wafer,this represents + 25% thickness variation.In MEMS sensors,such as pressure sensor,sensitivity of the sensor is directly related to SOI membrane thickness.High variability of thickness will result in poor device properties. Grinding of silicon wafers: A review from historical. However,the cost effectiveness of etched wafer fine grinding is only apparent if the depth of grinding induced damage is very shallow such that only a small removal is required in polishing.In order to reduce the damage depth on ground wafers,grinding wheels with very small diamond grains are desirable. Dicing and Grinding Using the Conventional Process (TGM.
