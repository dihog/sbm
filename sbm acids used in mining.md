Gold Parting using Nitric Acid A,B,and C were then boiled with 5cc.of strong acid,washed,dried,and weighed.The weights were: A—13.157.B—10.050.C— 9.990.It is therefore clear that 2 of silver and 1 of gold are sufficient for parting,and that 1.5 to one is ample if the resultant gold is subsequently treated by sulphuric acid or bisulphate of sodium.
