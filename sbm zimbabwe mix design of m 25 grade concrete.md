Road Standards and Paving Standards The types of paving covered by these standards are typically made of asphalt,concrete,and bituminous materials.These road and paving standards allow geotechnical engineering firms and construction companies to examine and evaluate paving materials to ensure strength and durability towards safe application and use. What is the mix ratio for grade 25 concrete The ratio of cement,sand and crushed stone in M 25 grade concrete is 1:1:2.In this grade of concrete a compressive strength not less than 25 N mm2 is achieved in 28 days.M15 manual mix. Grade of Concrete Their Ratio,Uses & Suitability. Grade of Concrete is the classification of concrete according to its compressive strength.For making concrete we use cement,sand,aggregate,and water which are mixed with certain ratio and concrete is cast and put in a cube of 150 mm size and put in a water bath for 28 days and afterward,it is tested in a compression test.
