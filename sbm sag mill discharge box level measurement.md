Sag Sag Mill Operation Procedure Sag Mill Grinding Circuit Design.Identification of the most economical sag mill operating conditions requires knowledge of the response of the sag mill to variations in control parameters such as mill discharge percent solids,sag speed,and volumetric load level,and to the effects of sag feed size and ore hardness changes on sag operation. Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills The SAG mill had a 6 8% ball charge and the power consumption was 8 kWh t,which agreed well with the expected value.9.6.Problems.9.1.In an SAG mill the dimensions of the mill were 9.75 m &#215; 3.5 m and the specific gravities of the mineral and that of the balls charged were 4.1 and 7.9,respectively.
