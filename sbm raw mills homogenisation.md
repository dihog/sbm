Homogenization (chemistry) Wikipedia Milk homogenization is accomplished by mixing massive amounts of harvested milk to create a constant,then forcing the milk at high pressure through small holes.Yet another method of homogenization uses extruders,hammermills,or colloid mills to mill (grind) solids.Milk homogenization is an essential tool of the milk food industry to prevent. From raw materials Extracting raw materials Raw material. The desired raw mix of crushed raw material and the additional components required for the type of cement,e.g.silica sand and iron ore,is prepared using metering devices.Roller grinding mills and ball mills grind the mixture to a fine powder at the same time as drying it,before it is conveyed to the raw meal silos for further homogenisation. PPC Sustainability report The other raw materials,normally shale,iron ore and sand,are also stored in stockpiles.Raw milling and homogenisation.Carefully measured quantities of the various raw materials are fed,via raw mill feed silos,to mills where steel balls grind the mat Homogenization (chemistry) Homogenization or homogenisation is any of several processes used to make a mixture of two mutually non soluble liquids the same throughout.This is achieved by turning one of the liquids into a state consisting of extremely small particles distributed uniformly throughout the other liquid.
