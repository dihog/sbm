Extraction of Iron : Processes and Procedure GulpMatrix 2019116&ensp&#0183&enspThe extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III)oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. Purifiion or Refining of Impure Metals By this method those metals can be purified which have low melting point.In this method the block of Impure metal is placed on the top side of sloping floor of a furnace and heated gently.Due to high temperature the fusible metal melts and flows down to the bottom of sloping floor while the nonfusible impurities remain behind on the floor. Tin Extraction Metalcess However,the tin concentrate grade of 40% is required,meaning the enrichment of hundreds or thousands times.Targeting at the refractory tin ore,low grade tin concentrate is obtained and it has to be further extracted by special metallurgy process.Reduction smelting is the dominant process to extract tin metal from tin concentrate. Steps in the Modern Steelmaking Process Steel is the world's most popular construction material because of its unique combination of durability,workability,and cost.It's an iron alloy that contains 0.22% carbon by weight.1 ﻿ According to the World Steel Association,some of the largest steelproducing countries are China,India,Japan,and the U.S.China accounts for roughly Iron Extraction Process Dillinger Iron Extraction Process.In the blast furnace process,the first step on the way towards heavy plate,pig iron is produced from iron ore.The composition of the ore and additions is accurately adjusted to the final products of AG der Dillinger Hüttenwerke and Saarstahl AG. copper extraction and purifiion 2015726&ensp&#0183&enspCopper can be extracted from nonsulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulphate solution.Concentration of the copper(II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.

Procedures for Metal Extraction.Concentration of Ores: Ores may be concentrated either by (i) Washing away the earthy materials in a stream of water in order to leave behind the heavier ores as is the case with tin ore or by (ii) Froth flotation where the ores are churned up with oil and water to form froth.This froth which contains the ore is skimmed off by blowing air. How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing Another process involves ground ore being passed over plates which are coated with mercury.The gold and the mercury form an amalgam,leading to the name of the process,amalgamation.Once the amalgam has formed,it is heated until the mercury gas is boiled off,leaving the gold.The mercury gas is highly toxic and must be handled carefully. Tin Ores Article about Tin Ores by The Free Dictionary Tin Ores natural mineral formations with a sufficiently high tin (Sn) content to make commercial extraction profitable.Cassiterite,which contains up to 78.8 percent Sn,is the most valuable tin ore.Stannite,with 27.5 percent Sn,also contains good industrial concentrations of Sn but is not very widely used because of the numerous difficulties.
