Sedimentary Rocks in Lab Illinois Wesleyan University The purpose of this lab is to learn to describe and classify sedimentary rocks.This requires first identifying the super group (coal,chert,siliciclastic,carbonate,evaporite),then describing the rock using the scheme for that super group.The first pass classification into super group mostly uses hardness and reaction with HCl.For siliciclastics,the next layer involves in grain size. Particle size Wikipedia Particle size is a notion introduced for comparing dimensions of solid particles (flecks),liquid particles (droplets),or gaseous particles (bubbles).The notion of particle size applies to colloidal particles,particles in ecology,particles present in granular material (whether airborne or not),and particles that form a granular material.
