Improvements in aggregate stability of sediments, Jun 07,2016&#0183;&#32;FYM and TW were applied to RDS at different rates (0%,25%,5%,75%,10%,125% and 15% w w),and aggregate stability was determined at different times of incubation (2 nd,4 th,6 th,8 th,10 th,14 th,and 18 th weeks) using wet sieving analysis The results showed that the aggregate stability of RDS treated with TW was statistically. The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Aggregate is classified as two different types,coarse and fine.Coarse aggregate is usually greater than 4.75 mm (retained on a No.4 sieve),while fine aggregate is less than 4.75 mm (passing the No.4 sieve).The compressive aggregate strength is an important factor in the selection of aggregate.
