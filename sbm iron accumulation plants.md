Physiological and Transcriptome Analysis of Iron and. Plants require a variety of nutrients for growth.Although iron (Fe) is quite abundant in the earth's crust,it is often a limiting resource for growth,due to low availability (Guerinot and Yi,1994).Fe deficient plants often develop interveinal chlorotic symptoms in young leaves and display a considerable decrease in leaf net photosynthetic rate (Briat et al.1995). Editorial: Iron Nutrition and Interactions in Plants The International Symposium of Iron Nutrition and Interaction in Plants (ISINIP) is a biannual meeting that covers a wide range of aspects,including but not limited to iron availability in the soil,the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis,and the exploration of novel avenues for fortifying plants with iron. Arsenic accumulation in duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza L. 2013 6 30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Robinson et al.(2006) also reported a positive correlation between arsenic and iron concentrations in aquatic plants since arsenic is adsorbed on iron oxides biosorbed on the plant surfaces.The actual species of arsenic adsorbed was not clear from their studies.
