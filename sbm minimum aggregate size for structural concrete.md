What's the best size of coarse aggregate in concrete … Generally the size of coarse aggregate used is 10 12.5 mm.If we use the proportional mix of different sizes small to large (&gt;4.5 mm to 20 25 mm),this make the concrete structure compact by align. 03 53 00 CONCRETE TOPPING psi Maximum size of aggregate shall be 1 inch,except that 3 8 inch maximum size aggregate shall be used for locations where congestion and other conditions indicate the need for smaller aggregate Minimum cement content per cubic yard of concrete shall be six and a half 94 pound sacks 2 Mix design for topping slab concrete shall include up. CONCRETE 101 Lightweight concrete is made using lightweight aggregates of expanded shale,clay and slag These are used to produce structural lightweight concrete with a freshly mixed unit weight of 90 to 120 pounds per cubic foot Normal weight concrete is typically 135 to 150 pounds per cubic foot A Review of ACI 301 Section 4,Concrete Mixtures inches.Concrete shall not show signs visible signs of segregation • Size of Coarse Aggregate • Unless otherwise specified,nominal size shall not exceed ¾ of minimum reinforcement spacing.1" 520 3 4" 540 3 8" 610 TABLE 4.2.2.1 — Minimum cementitious material content requirement for floors Nominal maximum size of aggregate,in. Structural Design of Foundations for the Home Inspector. ACI 318 allows two approaches to the design of reinforced concrete with some limits on wall thickness and the minimum amount of steel reinforcement; however,ACI 318 also permits these requirements to be waived in the event that structural analysis demonstrates adequate strength and stability in accordance with ACI 318•14.2.7. Aggregate size Concrete Construction Magazine At a given water ratio,within the range employed in most structural concrete,smaller maximum sizes of aggregate will tend to produce higher concrete strengths than larger ones.2.The larger sizes will require less mixing water and hence,for a given cement factor,will produce concrete of lower water ratio than the smaller sizes. CM 225 Given a structural design calling for 1 inch rebar with 2 inches of cover and a spacing of 2 inches center to center in a 9 inch thick wall section and the concrete is to be pumped through a 3 inch pipe,what is the nominal maximum aggregate size allowed by the ACI 318 08 code? Bridges The aggregate producer generally follows one of the procedures that are outlined in ACI 211.2,Recommended Practice for Selecting Proportions for Structural Lightweight Concrete.The degree of over design required depends on variability of test results. Properties of concrete aggregates A maximum size up to 40 mm is used for coarse aggregate in most structural applications,while for mass concreting purposes such as dams,sizes up to 150 mm may be used.Fine aggregates,on the other hand,have particles up to a minimum size of 0.075 mm.Typical particle size analyses of coarse and fine aggregates are shown in Figure 1. ACI Mix Design Pavement Interactive Maximum Aggregate Size Maximum aggregate size will affect such PCC parameters as amount of cement paste,workability and strength In general,ACI recommends that maximum aggregate size be limited to 1 3 of the slab depth and 3 4 of the minimum clear space between reinforcing bars HOW TO DECIDE MAXIMUM SIZE OF COARSE … Conditions That Decide Maximum Size of Coarse Aggregate to be Used in Concrete.The following conditions decide the maximum size of coarse aggregate to be used in concrete.It should not be more than one fourth of the minimum thickness of the member provided that the concrete can be placed without difficulty so as to aurround all reinforcement. Section 22 Typically,the minimum specified clear distance between forms will control the aggregate size ACI 318 14 252 also puts an effect limit on the maximum size of aggregat The language of the section is in terms of a limit on rebar spacing,however,it is fairly typical to limit aggregate size, Different Types & Sizes of Aggregate for Concrete.  · Gravel,cobble and boulders come under this category.The maximum size aggregate used may be dependent upon some conditions.In general,40mm size aggregate used for normal strengths and 20mm size is used for high strength concrete.The size range of various coarse aggregates given below: Fine gravel: 4mm 8mm.Medium gravel: 8mm 16mm Aggregates Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock,boulders,cobbles,or large size gravel.Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases,soil cement,and in new concrete.After harvesting,aggregate is processed: crushed,screened,and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

ACI 2111: Maximum Aggregate Size For Concrete Mix Design In this post I shall discuss maximum aggregate size that can be used in design Large maximum sizes of aggregates produce less voids than smaller siz Hence,concretes with the larger sized aggregates require less mortar per unit volume of concrete,and of coarse it is the mortar which contains the most expensive ingredient,cement SIP 3 Minimum Cementitious Materials Content 2015 7 10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;SIP 3 Minimum Cementitious Materials Content by the NRMCA Research Engineering and Standards Committee Table 1: Minimum cementitious materials content requirements for floors (Table 4.2.2.1 in ACI 301 10) Nominal maximum size of aggregate,in.Minimum cementitious materials content,lb yd3 1 1 2 470 1 520 3 4 540 3 8 610 CHAPTER 3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF LIGHTWEIGHT, structural lightweight concrete usually have a top size of minus 3 4 in or minus 1 2 in Most lightweight concretes use a lightweight coarse aggregate 3 4 in to #4 mesh (1 2 #8) with ordinary sand,minus #4 mesh (minus 48 mm),however other combinations of Specification Limits on Slab on Grade Placement Size May 13,2013&#0183;&#32;Specification Limits on Slab on Grade Placement Size,ACI 301 10 Specifications for Structural Concrete,This section includes minimum default specification provisions for, Minimum Aggregate Size for Flatwork &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I have numerous school site projects in Southern California,that require new concrete flatwork.The specificatons,which I wrote,specify a mix design of compressive strength minimum 4000psi,W C ratio 0.50 maximum,with 1 inch aggregate passing 95 100%. Aggregates for Use In Concrete Aggregate Size Effects: • As the maximum size aggregate increases,the amount of paste needed for a given slump decreases.• The maximum aggregate size used in a concrete mix is dictated by the size of the structural member and the spacing between reinforcing steel.“Design & Control of Concrete Mixtures,” 14 th Edition,Portland Cement Section 22 Typically,the minimum specified clear distance between forms will control the aggregate size ACI 318 14 252 also puts an effect limit on the maximum size of aggregat The language of the section is in terms of a limit on rebar spacing,however,it is fairly typical to limit aggregate size to meet these requirements Aggregates: Meaning and Classification Materials. However in structural concrete of usual proportions,from the strength point of view,use of greater size aggregate than 25 mm or 38 mm has not been found advantageous.There are structural limitations also on the size of the aggregate.As per I.S.416 1964 the maximum size should not be greater than 1 5 to 1 4 of the thickness of concrete section. Concrete Mix Design Guide CECALC Step 2,Choice of maximum aggregate size: If the maximum aggregate size is not specified,determine the maximum aggregate size for the mix Take into consideration Too Little Cover Concrete Construction Magazine We are continually running up against structural engineers who push the limits of the cover for rebar and post tensioning cables for suspended slabs in concrete structur We normally never like to work with rebar cover less than 1 4 inch above the aggregate size We are finishing an underground parking garage project where some of the floors lack sufficient concrete coverage on the bottom. Minimum Thickness of Concrete Slab,Beam,Column,Foundation Minimum thickness of concrete structural elements based on ACI 318 14,IRC 2009,IS 456 2000,and UBC 1997 is presented.Design process includes proper assumption of structural element sizes and then check the suggested dimensions to make sure that it meets the requirements of the design. Minimum Steel Reinforcement in Concrete and Clear … The minimum amount of steel reinforcement is defined as that for which &quot;peak load at first concrete cracking&quot; and &quot;ultimate load after steel yielding&quot; are equal.In this way,any brittle behavior is avoided as well as any localized failure,if the member is not over reinforced.In other words,there is a reinforcement percentage range,depending on the size scale, Concrete Q & A: Maximum Size versus Nominal Maximum Size. I intended this provision to mean that almost all of the coarse aggregate used in the concrete would pass the 1 in.(25.0 mm) sieve and some would be retained on the 3 4 in.(19.0 mm) sieve,such as a Size Number 57 stone per ASTM C33.1 The contractor,however,has interpreted this provision simply to mean that all of the coarse aggregate must.
